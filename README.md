# JavaScript-Algorithms
repo of all algorithms I solved on sites like codefights, freecodecamp

probably will not be updated consecutively, but I'm going to try.

CodeFights are more advanced, and these are:

⋅⋅* allLongestStrings
⋅⋅* almostIncreasingSequence
⋅⋅* matrixElementsSum
⋅⋅* makeArrayConsecutive2
⋅⋅*
⋅⋅*
⋅⋅*
⋅⋅*
⋅⋅*
